## Setup

This project uses [Vercel's Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction) as it backend.

To make it run locally, first you need to install vercel

```
npm i -g vercel
```

Then you need to configure Vercel running the command:

```
vercel
```

This will present you a series of questions to configure the project in Vercel's platform. After this is done you can run

```
vercel dev
```

To make the project run locally.
